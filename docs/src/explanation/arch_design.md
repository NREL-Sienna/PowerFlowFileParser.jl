# Architecture and Design Philosophy

PowerFlowFileParser.jl follows a clear separation of concerns:

**Parse, Don't Transform**: The library's primary responsibility is converting text files into simple, well-structured intermediate representations (dictionaries or typed structs). Conversion to domain-specific types like PowerSystems.jl components is handled downstream.

**Two Parsing Pathways**:

 1. **PowerModels-based**: Produces standardized dictionaries via `parse_file()` or `PowerModelsData`
 2. **PowerFlowData-based**: Produces typed structs via `PowerFlowDataNetwork`

This architecture keeps the parser lightweight, testable, and reusable across multiple downstream packages.

## Supported Formats

  - **MATPOWER (.m)**: Matlab-based case files common in academic research
  - **PSS/E RAW (.raw)**: Industry-standard format (versions 30, 32, 33, 35)

## Data Validation

The parser applies automatic corrections including:

  - Connectivity validation
  - Reference bus verification
  - Per-unit conversion
  - Transformer parameter correction
  - Thermal limit validation
