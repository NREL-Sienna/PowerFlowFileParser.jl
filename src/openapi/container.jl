"""
The document PowerFlowFileParser emits, as a thin wrapper composing the canonical
`PC.SystemDocument` rather than duplicating its state.

`document` is the ONLY serialized artifact: components, the association tables,
`ext` and the unit convention all live on it, reached through PC's own API
(`PC.add_component!`, `PC.get_components`, ...) so this wrapper does not
re-implement what the document already owns.

`registry` is build-time scaffolding and is not serialized: it delegates id
allocation to `document` (see `IdRegistry`) and keeps only the lookup indices
(by name, by bus number, by arc) that the document has no use for once built.

`time_series` mirrors PowerTableDataParser's field shape for a consistent
`OpenAPISystem` API across parsers, but PowerFlowFileParser emits no time series
today — PSS/E and Matpower carry none — so this stays permanently empty and no
reader ever appends to it.

Record that `entity_id` contributes to the service `service_id`.

A service membership is a row in the same unified `supplemental_attribute_associations`
table as every other attribute link (D10): `service_id` is emitted as `attribute_id` and
`attribute_type` names the service's own type, so a reader distinguishes a membership row
from a plain attribute by looking `attribute_id` up as a component rather than by any field
here. Neither `group_index` nor `role` applies to a membership row.

There is no `service_id` model object to hand `PC.add_supplemental_attribute!` — the
"attribute" here is a component that already exists — so this appends the association
row directly, which `PC.validate_document` already accounts for (it checks `attribute_id`
against components and attributes together for exactly this reason).

One row per pair, so each membership is individually addressable. Duplicate pairs are
rejected: the tables express membership as overlapping eligibility rules, so the same
device can match one reserve twice, and silently collapsing that would hide a malformed
rule set.
