# Node-breaker substation materialization. Expands the parsed `substation` section

# assigns them to. An out-of-service NODE materializes with the same encoding a BUS
# record with IDE=4 gets, so the devices wired to it are kept rather than dropped and
# each section's own isolated-bus check decides their fate as it parses them. The one
# section without such a check is `distributed_generation`, whose availability comes
# from the LOAD record's DGENM field alone; that is the same treatment it gets on a BUS
# record with IDE=4. An out-of-service DEVICE is kept with state 0. Runs inside the PTI
# conversion, before per-unit and validation, so voltages here are in raw-file units
# (angles in degrees).
